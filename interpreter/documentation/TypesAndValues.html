<h2>Types and Values</h2>
<p>
Nyx Language knows the following built-in types $Array$, $Boolean$, $ForeignFunction$,
$ForeignObject$, $Number$, $String$, and $Void$.
</p>
<p>
The type $Void$ has a single value $void$. It is used to denote the absence of any useful value and
is different from any other value. The type $Boolean$ has two values $true$ and $false$. The type
$String$ represents sequences of bytes. $Number$ is a double precision floating point type used to
represent integer values and real values. The $Array$ represents lists of values of any type.
$ForeignFunction$ and $ForeignObject$ values represent C functions and C objects. The set of all
types is denoted by $Types$.
