<h4>Relational Operations</h4>
<h5>Equality Relation Operations</h5>
<p>The equality relation operation are $EqualTo$ and $NotEqualTo$ which compute if two values are
equal or not equal, respectively. The inequality operation $\matthtt{NotEqualTo}$ is defined   in
terms of the logical negation operation and the equality operation.</p>

<h6>EqualTo</h6>
<p>$\mathtt{EqualTo}$ computes wether two values are equal where the value top of the stack is  the
second operand, the value below it the first operand. If there are less than two values on      the
stack, an $\mathtt{InvalidOperation}$ error is raised. The first operand and the second operand are
popped from the stack and the result of the comparison is pushed.</p>

<p>If two values are compared, first their types are compared. If the types are equal, then  their
values are compared.  Aggregates, foreign function, and foreign objects are compared by reference,
strings are equal if they represent the same sequence of Bytes, numbers and boolean values     are
equal if they represent the same mathematical value. The void value is equal to itself.</p>
