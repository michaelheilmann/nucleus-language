<h4>Arithmetic Operations</h4>
<h5>Additive Arithmetic Operations</h5>
<p>The two additive arithmetic operations are $\mathtt{Add}$ which computes the sum of two numeric
values and $\mathtt{Subtract}$ which computes the difference of two numeric values.</p>

<h6>Add</h6>
<p>$\mathtt{Add}$ computes the sum of two numeric   values
where the value on the top of the stack is the  addend,
the value below it the augend. If there are less   than
two values on the stack or they are not numeric values,
an $\mathtt{InvalidOperation}$ error is raised.
The augend and the addend are both popped from the stack and the sum is pushed on the stack.
</p>

\(
\mathtt{Add}\;
\begin{matrix}
{\Sigma_1}.InstructionIndex = i\;\;
{\Sigma_1}.Stack = \left[x, y\right] \circ w \;\;
x, y \in Number\\
\hline
{\Sigma_2}.InstructionIndex = i+ 1\;\;
{\Sigma_2}.Stack = \left[x + y\right] \circ w \;\;
z \in Number
\end{matrix}
\)
</p

<h6>Subtract</h6>
<p>$\mathtt{Subtract}$ computes the difference of two numeric   values
where the value on the top of the stack is the  subtrahend,
the value below it is the minuend. If there are less   than
two values on the stack or they are not numeric values,
an $\mathtt{InvalidOperation}$ error is raised.
The minuend and the subtrahend are both popped from the stack and the difference is pushed on the stack.
<p>
\(
\mathtt{Subtract}\;
\begin{matrix}
{\Sigma_1}.InstructionIndex = i\;\;
{\Sigma_1}.Stack = \left[x, y\right] \circ w\;\;
x, y \in Number\\
\hline
{\Sigma_2}.InstructionIndex = i+ 1\;\;
{\Sigma_2}.Stack = \left[x - y\right] \circ w\;\;
z \in Number
\end{matrix}
\)
</p>

<h5>Multiplicative Arithmetic Operations</h5>
<p>The two multiplicative arithmetic operations are $\mathtt{Multiply}$ which computes the product
of two numeric values and $\mathtt{Divide}$ which computes the quotient of two numeric values.</p>

<h6>Multiply</h6>
<p>$\mathtt{Multiply}$ computes the product of two numeric   values
where the value on the top of the stack is the  multiplier,
the value below it is the multiplicand. If there are less   than
two values on the stack or they are not numeric values,
an $\mathtt{InvalidOperation}$ error is raised.
The multiplicand and the multiplier are both popped from the stack and the product is pushed on the stack.

\(
\mathtt{Multiply}\;

{\Sigma_1}.InstructionIndex = i\;\;
{\Sigma_1}.Stack = \left[x, y\right] \circ w \;\;

\hline
{\Sigma_2}.InstructionIndex = i+ 1\;\;
{\Sigma_2}.Stack = \left[x \cdot y\right] \circ w \;\;
z \in Number
\end{matrix}
\)

<h6>Divide</h6>
<p>$\mathtt{Subtract}$ computes the quotient of two numeric   values
where the value on the top of the stack is the  divisor,
the value below it is the dividend. If there are less   than
two values on the stack or they are not numeric values,
an $\mathtt{InvalidOperation}$ error is raised.
The dividend and the divisor are both popped from the stack and the quotient is pushed on the stack.

{\Sigma_2}.Stack = \left[x / y\right] \circ w\;\;
z \in Number
