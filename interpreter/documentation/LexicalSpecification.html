<h2>Lexical</h2>
<p>Nyx Language ignores ignores spaces (including new lines) and comments between lexical
elements (words), except as delimiters between names and keywords.</p>

<p><em>Names</em> (also called identifiers) in Nyx language can be any non-empty string of letters,
digits, and underscores, not beginning with a digit and not being a reserved word. Names are  used
to  form <em>qualified names</em> which is a sequence of one or more names where every         two
consecutive names are separated by a period.</p>

<p><em>Directives</em> are qualified names with a leading period.</p>
